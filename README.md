# Get your Weather

**Intro** - For the final project in this course, we were tasked to build a program which would take a zipcode or city as an input and tell you the weather by the use of an API.

**Tools** - Python, API

**Data** - Link to API: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={}&units=Imperial&appid=b113d0d8b55fc09fcee342931907c51a

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - API, Error Catching, Function Creation

**Conclusion** - This program works to help get your weather just like if you were to look it up online. With a little modification, you could even have the weather texted to your phone.
